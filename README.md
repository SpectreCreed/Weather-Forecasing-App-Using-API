## Project Dependences
Dependencies are the package references that are used by our library without which it cannot 
work and to be installed along with your library installation automatically. While looking at 
peer Dependencies, python will just throw a warning message in case the specified packages 
are not found in python modules. You can install those modules using pip command through cmd.
